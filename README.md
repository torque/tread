## tread, _(v)_
### 5. _trans_ c. _fig._ “To crush, to oppress; to treat with contemptuous cruelty.”

More accurately, _tread_ is a rather lousy portmanteau that I settled upon when searching for a name with a bit more flair than “local-js-browser-based-torrent-reader-with-a-drag-and-drop-interface”.

_tread_ is being developed utilizing time-tested programming paradigms, such as the "the first thing that comes to mind" method of problem solving. It is built on (and builds upon) emerging, scalable web technologies such as _HTML5_, _CoffeeScript_, _ECMAScript, 5th Edition_, _CSS3_, _ZeptoJS_, _DOMs_, _The World Wide Web_, and even _Your Web Browser_. This allows it to provide state-of-the-art services at speeds best viewed on a geological timescale.
